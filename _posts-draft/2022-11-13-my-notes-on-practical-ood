## Chapter 3. Managing Dependencies

### Writing loosely coupled code
Even before being DRY requires it, try to remove external dependencies and encapsulate them in methods of their own. Strive to have complex methods only depend to messages sent to _self_.

### Remove argument-order dependencies
Use keyword arguments in the `initialize` method to avoid depending on positional arguments. This also allows us to add or remove initialization arguments and defaults to the class definition without worrying about side effects. The added verbosity is paid off by removing the risk that future changes will cascade into dependents.
