Hi I'm Filippo, a web dev who likes peanuts, amongst other things.  

This is where I come to write about code. I've never been much of a writer, probably because I've never written for pleasure, always in an academic context. Writing down what I was studying was my primary tool for memorizing and solidifying knowledge. First in school, then through University, this tool has always served me well. 

After graduation, I rarely wrote anything except emails. But I never stopped learning, so why did I stop writing things down? 

Honestly, I think it's exams. 
An exam doesn't only require you to know your stuff, it forces you to be able to explain it effectively. Once I ventured out in the professional world, I became obsessed about knowing more and more stuff. I've often listened to podcasts or watched youtube videos at 1.5-2x speed to get through more material more quickly.
