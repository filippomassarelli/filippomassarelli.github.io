Hi I'm Filippo, a web dev who likes peanuts, amongst other things.  

This is where I come to write about code. I've never written for pleasure, always in an academic context. Writing down what I was studying was my primary tool for memorizing and solidifying knowledge. First in school, then through University, this tool has always served me well. 

After graduation, I suddenly stopped writing anything except emails. But I never stopped learning, so why did I stop writing things down? 

I think the reason is exams, or the lack of them. By forcing you to be able to articulate and explain your acquired knowledge effectively, exams are what make you write things down when studying. Once I ventured out in the professional world however, I was no longer assessed and therefore stopped "wasting time" writing things down in favour of absorbing more information more rapidly by reading books, listening to podcasts or watching videos. 

Well, it is now clear to me that writing is an important tool for truly learning and mastering a subject. 

So I guess this blog is my attempt to make up for a life without exams.
