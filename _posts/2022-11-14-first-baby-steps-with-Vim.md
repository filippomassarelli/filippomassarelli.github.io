> **üéØ** In this post I talk about my first steps with Vim and my plan for becoming a decent Vimmer in 2023 

> **üôè** Special thanks to [Ana Nunes da Silva](https://www.ananunesdasilva.com/) who, without realising, inspired me to setup this blog and embark on this Vim journey.

The first time I witnessed Vim being used at work I found it impressive and, well .. quite intimidating too. Aren't VScode bells and whistles supposed to make you more productive? Would I really transcend as a developer by giving up the trackpad and a pretty GUI? 

_"I'll never know untill I try"_ is the same argument that got me into coding in the first place and here it came again for Vim, growing steadily in the back of my mind. So I finally decided to add _"Becoming decent at Vim"_ to my 2023 goals shortlist. 

## My first steps

- **Vimtutor:** As Ana recommends in her blog ["A step by step approach to vim"](https://www.ananunesdasilva.com/posts/step-by-step-vim) my first step has been to open my terminal and type `vimtutor`. It took me a couple of days to complete the whole thing but it was definitely the best primer i could have asked for, very hands-on.
- **Vimium:** This is a [browser extension](https://vimium.github.io/) which allows you to navigate pages and tabs without a mouse or touchpad. As a dev you spend a lot of time searching the web so I thought it a good idea to get used to using the keyboard more, even though the commands might not be directly transferrable.
- **Practice:** Rather than practicing straight in my day job, I thought it best to have a pet project I would develop in Vim from start to finish. Since I also wanted a personal site, I decided to kill two birds with one stone and code this blog entirely in Vim. It's no chance that the first post is on Vim!   

## My plan for the new year

Like any goal, I'll need (1) drills to practice consistently, ideally embedded in a daily routine. I'll need a set of (2) challenges, ideally that increase in difficulty throughout the year, and I'll need a way to (3) measure and track progress.

### 1. Drills

#### Study notes
Every morning I spend about 1hr studying to improve as an Engineer. Right now I am going through the book [Practical Object-Oriented Design](https://www.informit.com/store/practical-object-oriented-design-an-agile-primer-using-9780134456478?ranMID=24808) by Sandi Metz but in the future it could be a tutorial or one of the dozens Udemy courses I started but never finished. Regardless, I've decided that I'll take the time to write down something new I learned in every study session in this blog. And since I'll only use Vim for this blog I'm guaranteed to get in some daily (or at least wekly) Vim practice.

#### VS Code extension
I've seen that there is a [Vim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) for Visual Studio Code. I plan to give that a try in order to start occasionally using Vim's commands at work without slowing down too much. My major concern is search. I'm so used to navigating and exploring codebases with the search UI provided by VS Code that I think it will be the major hurdle to overcome and I doubt that the VS Code extension allows you to bypass the GUI search but we'll see.
  
### 2. Challenges
I'm still not sure what challenges I'd like to set but I want these to be quarterly challenges. At the end of each quarter I need to have a well defined challenge to attempt (and look forward to hopefully). For now these are some ideas:
- complete 1 PR at work using only Vim
- complete 1 sprint at work using only Vim
- pair with a good Vimmer and get him/her to grill me

### 3. Tracking
As far as tracking progress, I will just keep it simple and commit to writing one Vim quarterly progress blog post at the end of each quarter. This way I can more effectively capture what I learned and what I think requires more work. A more qualitative approach usually works well for me especially when there isn't an truly objective way to quantify the level of mastery of a skill. In this case it's more about my perceived confidence and productivity rather than any absolute measure like speed of typing or what not.

## Bring it on

I'll check back in with a _"Vim Q1 progress"_ blog post üëã
